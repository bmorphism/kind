The market can be modeled as a non-cooperative game where each agent's decision affects the overall outcome of the game. The agents can be electric vehicle owners, solar panel owners, battery owners, and other market players.\n\nIn this game, the objective of each agent is to minimize their cost while maximizing their profit. The cost for an electric vehicle owner is the cost of charging their vehicle, while the profit is the revenue generated from selling excess energy back to the grid. The cost for a solar panel owner is the cost of generating energy, while the profit is the revenue generated from selling excess energy back to the grid. The cost for a battery owner is the cost of storing energy, while the profit is the revenue generated from selling excess energy back to the grid.\n\nTo optimize the power usage of your vehicle and maximize profits, you can collaborate with other DER participants to form a coalition. The coalition can work together to coordinate the charging and discharging of vehicles and other DERs based on the energy demand in the grid. You can use optimization algorithms, fuzzy logic, or cooperative game theory to facilitate effective collaboration and decision-making within the coalition.\n\nFor example, the coalition",
